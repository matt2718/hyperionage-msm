# Hyperionage

This repository contains custom `stack` snapshots (resolvers) for `hyperion` and related packages used in numerical bootstrap projects.

Forked from https://github.com/pkravchuk/hyperionage/ . Most of the stuff in here involves small tweaks for personal use (e.g. targeting Stackage snapshots more recent library versions, or GHC releases that are still supported by HLS, etc), and are unlikely to diverge that much from upstream.
